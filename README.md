# Hello.World2.0
Hello Slav here. Here is my second attempt at understanding how to use GitHub.
Honestly is simpler that i would have thought at first glance because I felt really scared of starting a new thing like is usual
Well about myself, I'm and up and coming game developer that wants to help in the development of an indie game called tidetale by my friends at Distal Studios 
Currently struggling in learning C# but i really need to make an effort if I really want to make this my career. Well guess i just have to keep the pace
Good luck future me :).
